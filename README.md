# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

For this project I had to use my knowledge of Javascript to create a random password generator. This project came with starter code that I bult upon to finish the assignment. I created variables and arrays containing the different characters to use as options for the potential passwords that were to be generated. I used prompts and alerts to comunicate and get information from the user and I took the information I recieved and used if and for statements to randomly generate the passwords. This project really pushed me to my limits but proved to myself that with time and dedication I am capable of learning new techniques that are very useful. w3schools was a lot of help on this assignment as was google and stack overflow.
